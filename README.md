This guide provides an introduction to using Terraform for managing AWS infrastructure. Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage cloud resources in a safe, efficient, and repeatable way.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed (v1.0.0 or later)
- Basic knowledge of AWS services (EC2, S3, VPC)

## Getting Started

### Install Terraform
Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

### Configure AWS Credentials
Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

### Initialize Terraform
Initialize Terraform to download the necessary providers:
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan and Apply the Configuration
Check what Terraform will create or change by running:
```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply the configuration to create the resources:
```bash
terraform apply
```

## Manage Resources
Terraform tracks your resources in a state file (`terraform.tfstate`). To update or destroy resources:

- **Update:** Modify `main.tf`, then run `terraform apply`.
- **Destroy:** Remove resources by running:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
```
